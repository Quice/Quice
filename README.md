<h2>
	Technologies used
</h2>

<p>
	Here is a list of the technologies we use:
</p>

<!-- - **Vue.js**

	Vue.js was chosen for its great potential. Thanks to its modularity we are convinced that Vue.js is a technology that will dominate in the future. The arrival of its third version seems to confirm it.

	Moreover, despite its power, the framework is very simple to use and understand, which is very positive for collaboration. -->

Because we want to be a young project, which uses the next-gen technologies, we will use these technologies:

- For the application, **Flutter** â†’ https://github.com/flutter/flutter

	Flutter is the future of Mobile App Development. The feature that convinced us the most is the creation of cross-platform applications based on a single code base.
	
	You can know more about why we chose Flutter by reading [this article](https://dev.to/joebrain032/13-reasons-why-flutter-is-the-future-of-mobile-app-development-240n).

- For the backend, **Go** â†’ https://github.com/golang/go

	Go is a recent popular language. It is fast, powerful, and has a super community.

	Go is a super language for the backend. It is one of the simplest languages, it compiles lightning-quick into fast native code and has excellent support for concurrency with goroutines and channels.

- For the machine learning and data science part, **Julia** â†’ https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia

	Julia is a very recent language which is very promising. It is a very fast language, which has a lot of data science and machine learning integrations.

- For the database, **MariaDB** â†’ https://github.com/MariaDB/

	MariaDB is a reference in the RDBMS. It provides the best rapidity for the less of resources. That's why we chose it.

<h2>
	Best Practices
</h2>

<p>
	Here a list of the internal Best Practices we use:
<p>

- [Best Practices for Flutter](https://medium.com/flutter-community/flutter-best-practices-and-tips-7c2782c9ebb5)
- [Best Practices for Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- [Best Practices for Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go)
- [Best Practices for Julia](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/style-guide/)
- [Best Practices for MariaDB](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/)
- [Best Practices for commit messages (Emoji commit messages)](https://gitmoji.dev/)
- [Best Practices for REST API](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/)

<h2>
	Formatting
</h2>

To keep the project clean and readable, each file should be commited following the formatting of the [.prettierrc file](./.prettierrc). Of course, you are free to format the code as you want when you are editing it.

The [.prettierrc file](./.prettierrc) will be in all repository.
