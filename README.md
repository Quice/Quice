<h2>
	Technologies used
</h2>

<p>
	Here is a list of the technologies we use:
</p>

<!-- - **Vue.js**

	Vue.js was chosen for its great potential. Thanks to its modularity we are convinced that Vue.js is a technology that will dominate in the future. The arrival of its third version seems to confirm it.

	Moreover, despite its power, the framework is very simple to use and understand, which is very positive for collaboration. -->

- **Kotlin** → https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin

	Kotlin is both the language recommended by Google for mobile development and a language supporting cross-platform, which can allow us to develop a version for iOS faster, while still being efficient. This choice is therefore obvious...

- **Node.js** → https://github.com/nodejs/node

	Node.js was a very quick choice. It is very powerful and has a lot of modules (libraries) including Express.js. That alone made us choose Node.js for the back-end part.

- **TypeScript** → https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript

	We have found that a code written in JavaScript in a constantly evolving project is very difficult to maintain in the long term, partly due to the fact that it leaves too much freedom, which can eventually lead to some bugs...

	This is why we chose to write all the back-end code in TypeScript, which allows us to anticipate many errors and thus improve collaboration...

	Typescript will be used with Node.js.

- **Node-tap** → https://github.com/tapjs/node-tap

	Node-tap's philosophy corresponds to our vision. It is therefore quite natural that we have chosen to use it as a unit testing for Node.js.

- **MariaDB** → https://github.com/MariaDB/

	MariaDB is a reference in the RDBMS. It provide the best rapidity for the less of resources. That's why we chose it.
